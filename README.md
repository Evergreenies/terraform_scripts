# Terraform Sample Scripts

Few important commands to run `.tf` files -

The `terraform init` command is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files.
```shell
terraform init
```

The `terraform plan` command is used to create an execution plan.
```shell
terraform plan
```

The `terraform apply` command is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a `terraform plan` execution plan.
```shell
terraform apply
```

The `terraform destroy` command is used to destroy the Terraform-managed infrastructure.
```shell
terraform destroy
```
